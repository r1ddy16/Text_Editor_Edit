# Simple_Text_Editor
# Simple text editor in Python using the Tkinter library
# This code creates a basic text editor GUI using the Tkinter library. It includes an open file option, save file option, and an exit option in the file menu. The text area is where the user can enter and edit text.
# When the user selects the open option, a file dialog is displayed to choose a file to open, and the content of the file is loaded into the text area.
# When the user selects the save option, a file dialog is displayed to choose a file to save, and the content of the text area is saved into the selected file. 
# The program runs in the main loop until the user closes the window.
